Challenge :
Crack the password expected by the provided Python checker to reveal the flag.

1. Download the challenge files and open the Python script. For example:

# assuming files are in current directory
ls -l
nano level1.py    # or: cat level1.py


Inspect the script. Look for a variable or list that contains password candidates or a single hardcoded password.
Typical patterns to look for:

password = "...."

pos_pw_list = [...]

any hex/ASCII sequences that are converted into a short string

Example â€” the key part of the script (excerpt):

# pseudo-excerpt similar to what you'll see in the challenge
# pos_pw_list or a direct assignment
password = "545h"   # <-- example of a hardcoded password in the script
# later: the script checks user input against this value and prints the flag


Use the password you found and run the script:

python3 level1.py
# when prompted, paste/type the password you found


The script will decrypt/print the flag if the password is correct. Example output:
Correct! Here is your flag:
picoCTF{***********}
